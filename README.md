# Secret Hitler Mobile Companion <img src="/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png" width="10%" align="left">
An Android App intended to make the board game experience of Secret Hitler more easy and fun. 

## Overview and Features
- **Keep track of your Game Events.** You might know that moment - you have entered Hitler zone and now want to see who can be trusted the most. But what did that person do again? Did he play a liberal or a fascist policy? What did he claim? By entering all events into the App, you can now easily see them in a Card-based list and even filter to only show events including certain players!
- **Make it accessible to everyone.** It might be quite counterproductive to leave your phone in the middle of the table for everyone to look at. That's why there is the option to start a Web Server. That way, only one person uses the app to add events, while everyone else can see it through their web browser.
- **Set the mood.** Who has once played the online game SecretHitler.io will probably remember the sounds used on the website. For everyone that wants to play the sounds during their "offline" session - you are in luck! The host device will, if enabled, play all important sounds, including when a policy has been enacted or when a player has been executed.
- **Minimal permissions used.** The following permissions are required:
  - *FOREGROUND_SERVICE* - to be able to run the Web Server in a Foreground Service, thus making it more stable
  - *INTERNET* - To be able to start and use the Web Server
  - *ACCESS_WIFI_STATE* - To be able to retrieve the device's IP address
  - *ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE* - To be able to determine the type of connection (WiFi, mobile hotspot etc.)
- **Free and Open Source.** Licensed under the <a href="LICENSE">GPLv3 license</a>
