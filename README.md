## Overview and Features
- **Keep track of your Game Events.** You might know that moment - you have entered Hitler zone and now want to see who can be trusted the most. But what did that person do again? Did he play a liberal or a fascist policy? What did he claim? By entering all events into the App, you can now easily see them in a Card-based list and even filter to only show events including certain players! Depending on the amount of players, the app also automatically creates Presidential Powers (such as a Loyalty Investigation) for you once a fascist policy has been played. This can also be customised using custom Tracks to play game modes like Gun Game!
- **Make it accessible to everyone.** It might be quite counterproductive to leave your phone in the middle of the table for everyone to look at. That's why there is the option to start a Web Server. That way, only one person uses the app to add events, while everyone else can see it through their web browser! This requires all devices to be in the same WiFi-network.
- **Set the mood.** Who has once played the online game SecretHitler.io will probably remember the sounds used on the website. For everyone that wants to play the sounds during their "offline" session - you are in luck! The host device will - if enabled - play all important sounds, including when a policy has been enacted or when a player has been executed.
- **Minimal permissions used.** The following permissions are required:
  - *FOREGROUND_SERVICE* - to be able to run the Web Server in a Foreground Service, thus making it more stable
  - *INTERNET* - To be able to start and use the Web Server
  - *ACCESS_WIFI_STATE* - To be able to retrieve the device's IP address
  - *ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE* - To be able to determine the type of connection (WiFi, mobile hotspot etc.)
- **Free and Open Source.** Licensed under the <a href="LICENSE">GPLv3 license</a>
