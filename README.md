# Secret Hitler Mobile Companion
An Android App intended to make the board game experience of Secret Hitler more easy and fun.

# Overview and Features
- **Keep track of your Game Events.** You might know that moment - you have entered Hitler zone and now want to see who can be trusted the most. But what did that person do again? Did he play a liberal or a fascist policy? What did he claim? By entering all events into the App, you can now easily see them in a Card-based list and even filter to only show events including certain players!
- **Make it accessible to everyone.** It might be quite counterproductive to leave your phone in the middle of the table for everyone to look at. That's why there is the option to start a Game Server. That way, only one person uses the app to add events, while everyone else can see it through their web browser.
- **Set the mood.** Who has once played the online game SecretHitler.io will probably remember the sounds used on the website. For everyone that wants to play the sounds during their "offline" session - you are in luck! The host device will, if enabled, play all important sounds, including when a policy has been enacted or a player has been executed.
- **Free and open Source**
